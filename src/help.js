  gameEditMenu:

`This is the game edit menu. It's basically the hub of where work on your game happens; you can get to most other common actions from here (or by following one of the submenus here).

* [General Game Data] gives you access to messing around with general settings for the game.

* [Open Level] lets you open and edit or test an existing level. Levels are maps of your game; they're where the player's hero will walk around.

* [New Level] lets you make a new level from scratch.

* [Open Entity] and [New Entity] let you open or create entities, which are the characters and such you can place around your levels.`,

  // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  generalGameDataMenu:

`This is the general game data menu. It lets you change various miscallenous properties related to your game.

Well.. that's the idea.. but there aren't actually any options like that yet. One day!

* [Reveal game package path] does just that, opening a system-file-browser window with your game's package folder selected. This is what you archive and send to someone when you want to share your game. This option only works on macOS.`,

  // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  helpOnHelp:

`You found the help-on-help screen!

Pressing F1 or the question mark key (shift and "/") will make the help menu show up.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll; try Page Up and Page Down (or hold shift while pressing the appropriate arrow key) to scroll a whole screen in one go.

Once you're done reading what you want to, press escape to get out.`,

  // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  helpOnHelpOnHelp:

`Yes, yes, you're very funny. And I'm not being sarcastic! I wouldn't have added this screen if I didn't have as terrible a sense of humour as you!

(Press escape to to back to the help-on-help menu.)`,
